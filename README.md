This is a high-fidelity prototype of a mobile ordering app for Levering Kitchens, an on-campus dining locations at JHU. 
Developed with the scrum process and user-centered design based on user surveys and research.
This models Levering Kitchen, a food court-esque dining hall composed of different restaurants.
Only Fresh and Butterfly, the salad and taco restaurants, were fully developed for the sake of this prototype.
Also links to a Firebase database to store user's past orders for ease in re-ordering.
Menus and ordering implemented with object-oriented design, utilizing inheritance, polymorphism, and serializability to
interact with the database.
